"""
This module checks for updates to the ModsUpdater script itself by comparing the current version with the latest version available on ModDB via their API.

It fetches and parses the API response to extract version information and download URLs.
Key functionalities include:
- Determining the correct API URL based on the operating system.
- Fetching and parsing the ModDB API response to locate version information and download links.
- Extracting the latest version number and download URL from the JSON content.
- Comparing the current script version with the latest available version.
- Returning a boolean indicating whether an update is available, along with the download URL, latest version and changelog text.
- Handling potential network errors and JSON parsing issues, with appropriate logging.
